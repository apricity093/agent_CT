"""Abstract forward operators for inverse problems y = A(x) + n.

Two layers of abstraction:

* `ForwardOperator` — the most general case. A may be non-linear (phase
  retrieval, blind deblurring, saturated sensing, MRI with non-Cartesian
  trajectories, etc.). The only requirement is that `forward` is
  autograd-traceable, so that gradient-based solvers (DIP, INR, DPS, RED,
  variational methods) can backprop through L = loss(A(x), y).

* `LinearOperator` — A is linear. Adds `adjoint` (transpose-vector product)
  and a default `pseudo_inverse`. Solvers that require an explicit adjoint
  (FBP, SIRT, Landweber, PiGDM, ...) take this subtype.

CT is a linear inverse problem, so the operators in `operators/ct/` inherit
from `LinearOperator`. Non-linear operators inherit from `ForwardOperator`
directly.
